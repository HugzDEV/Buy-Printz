# 🚀 Railway Playwright Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Railway Configuration Updated**

Your Railway deployment is now configured to install Playwright browsers **during the container build process**. This is the correct approach for Railway.

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **1. Updated Dockerfile**
- ✅ **Removed Chrome/Selenium dependencies**
- ✅ **Added Playwright system dependencies**
- ✅ **Added Playwright browser installation** (`playwright install chromium`)
- ✅ **Added system dependencies installation** (`playwright install-deps chromium`)
- ✅ **Updated startup script** to use `backend.shipping_costs_api:router`

### **2. Updated railway.json**
- ✅ **Updated health check path** to `/api/shipping-costs/health`
- ✅ **Removed Chrome-specific environment variables**
- ✅ **Added Playwright environment variables**

## 🚀 **How Railway Deployment Works**

### **Build Process (Automatic)**
1. **Railway pulls your code** from GitHub
2. **Builds Docker container** using your `Dockerfile`
3. **Installs Python dependencies** from `requirements.txt`
4. **Installs Playwright browsers** (`playwright install chromium`)
5. **Installs system dependencies** (`playwright install-deps chromium`)
6. **Starts the application** with the shipping costs API

### **No Manual Installation Required**
- ❌ **Don't run installation locally** - it won't help
- ❌ **Don't SSH into Railway** - browsers are installed during build
- ✅ **Just push to GitHub** - Railway handles everything automatically

## 📋 **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Push Changes to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update Railway deployment for Playwright B2Sign integration"
git push
```

### **2. Railway Auto-Deploys**
- Railway detects the push
- Automatically rebuilds the container
- Installs Playwright browsers during build
- Deploys the updated application

### **3. Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/api/shipping-costs/health

# Check Playwright status
curl https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/api/shipping-costs/playwright-status
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After Railway rebuilds your container:

- ✅ **Health check returns "healthy"**
- ✅ **Playwright status shows "installed"**
- ✅ **B2Sign integration works without browser errors**
- ✅ **Shipping costs API returns real data in 15-20 seconds**

## 🔍 **Monitoring Deployment**

### **Check Railway Logs**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the build logs for:
   ```
   playwright install chromium
   playwright install-deps chromium
   ```

### **Verify Playwright Installation**
Look for these log messages:
```
✅ Installing Chromium browser...
✅ System dependencies installed successfully
✅ Playwright verification successful
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Build Fails**
1. **Check Railway build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify requirements.txt** includes `playwright==1.40.0`
3. **Check Dockerfile syntax** is correct
4. **Ensure all dependencies** are properly listed

### **If Playwright Still Fails**
1. **Check the playwright-status endpoint** after deployment
2. **Look for specific error messages** in the response
3. **Verify system dependencies** were installed during build
4. **Check Railway environment variables** are set correctly

## 📊 **Build Time Expectations**

- **Initial build**: 3-5 minutes (installing Playwright browsers)
- **Subsequent builds**: 1-2 minutes (browsers cached)
- **Deployment time**: 30-60 seconds after build completes

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know the deployment worked when:

1. **Railway build completes successfully**
2. **Health endpoint returns "healthy"**
3. **Playwright status shows "installed"**
4. **B2Sign shipping costs API works**
5. **No more "Executable doesn't exist" errors**

---

**The key point: Railway installs Playwright browsers during the Docker build process, not at runtime. Just push your changes and Railway handles everything! 🚀**
